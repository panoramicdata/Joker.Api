This is description of DMAPI, oriented mostly to experienced users.
	
The description reflects interface version 1.2.*

Basics:
=======

	Requests to the DMAPI (Domain Management API) are simply HTTP POST (or GET)
	requests.
	
	NOTE: Only TLS is supported!

	The request parameters are passed as standard www-form variables, URL
	encoded, i.e. example for login request:

		https://dmapi.joker.com/request/login?username=user@joker.com&password=pass
	
	Server responses are plain-text messages, with headers (MIME-like), followed
	by LF, followed by reply body, like this (response to login request):

---reply---
Auth-SID: <session-id>

com
net
org
---reply---

	This way, even web-browsers might be used to send requests and to
	read replies (may be useful for testing).

	Most common headers fields, returned by most requests:

Tracking-Id:	Unique server-assigned tracking id, assigned to almost all
		requests. Please include this Id (if present) in case if
		you are reporting problem related to failed request.
Status-Code:	Not 0 if error occurred
Status-Text:	Human-friendly error description
Result:		ACK or NACK
Proc-ID:	Joker.com processing ID, usually generated for all requests that
		modify or create objects (domains/contacts/nameservers).
Account-Balance:
		Current reseller's account balance. Please note, that
		this value may be slightly outdated, and should be used
		only as a reference.

Error:		May be returned if (and only if) the request was rejected,
		in this case reason(s) will be provided. Presence of this
		line in headers is indicative that processing didn't take
		place.
Warning:	Indicative of non-fatal processing or validation problems.

Columns:	List of columns names, separated by comma (for list queries)
		If not present, see request description.
Separator:	List column separator (TAB is "\t", SPACE is " ")
		If not present, defaults to SPACE (or as specified in request)

	HTTP error codes: 200 if everything is OK (request was accepted and
	processed or queued for processing), otherwise the reason will be
	provided in Error header lines (or, if this is absent, HTTP error
	code should be used).

	NOTE: Regardless of HTTP error code, please examine response body,
	it may contain useful tips (in Error or Warning headers) why request
	failed.

	IMPORTANT: Every request (except login) *requires* presence of
	"auth-sid" parameter, which is returned by the "login" request. Active
	session will expire after some inactivity period (default 1 hour).

	Example:

		https://dmapi.joker.com/request/query-domain-list?auth-sid=20ddb8c3b2ea758dcf9fa4c7f46c0784
		
	In case if you use a browser to access this interface, then session id
	will be send as a cookie, hence need not to be specified as Auth-Sid
	(unless cookies are not supported or turned off). In any case,
	"auth-sid" has precedence, if provided.
	
	NOTE: Session may become invalid due to various reasons, so please
	don't expect it to be valid forever. Instead, design your application
	in a way, that, if your request is rejected because of authorization
	failure, send "login" request again, and only if it fails, stop processing.
	
	In request descriptions below, "Requires" section defines variables
	(sometimes referred as fields) that MUST be present, "Accepts"
	section defines variables that MAY be present (but not required),
	and "Returns" section describes request output - header fields and
	extra data (if any). If "Returns" is omitted, then standard reply
	should be expected (Status-Code, Status-Text, Proc-ID etc.).

	All variable and request names are case-insensitive.

Differences to existing email-gateway
=====================================

	DMAPI only accepts pre-registered contact and name-server handles.
	It means that before you can register (or modify) domain, you MUST
	register all necessary contacts and name-servers.

	Unlike email interface, there is no differentiation in requests for
	different domain/contact types.
	
	Some requests are asynchronous, and acceptance of request by the
	DMAPI is not necessarily means that it is processed (or will be
	processed at all). The real reply (acknowledgement or refusal) will
	be stored on the server and can be retrieved later. To list
	available replies you should use requests "result-list",
	"result-retrieve" and "result-delete" periodically.
	
	NOTE: Not retrieved replies will be kept on the server for period of
	90 days, then only status of specific request will be available
	(success or failure).
	
	IMPORTANT: Please also note that registration/renewal period is in
	MONTHS, NOT YEARS! This is to allow future micro-registrations.
	
DISCLAIMER
==========

	Please be aware, that, in some circumstances, your request might be
	refused, not processed or processed incorrectly (unlikely, but still
	possible).
	
	However, the DMAPI is supported feature, so your feedback is greatly
	appreciated.
	
	By using DMAPI, you agree to General Terms & Conditions of Joker.com:

	It is recommended, when using DMAPI, to switch to API keys
	instead of username/password.

	Using this request you can register the domain.
	
	NOTE: You *must* have registered contacts to be able to register a domain!
		
	IMPORTANT: Please note that registration period is in MONTHS, NOT YEARS! This
	is to allow future micro-registrations (in development).

	renewals are not refundable.
		
	IMPORTANT: Please note that registration period is in MONTHS, NOT YEARS!
	
	"expyear" is a safe option which can be used instead of "period" to
	renew domain till specified year (not longer). If you use "period",
	and by mistake send the request more than once, domain will be renewed
	again, while with "expyear", it will not be renewed if it's expiration
	year is greater or equals to specified.

	If "period" or "expyear" is not specified, privacy is ordered for all remaining lifetime
	of a domain, i.e. if domain expires in 5 years, then privacy will be ordered for 5 years,
	but if domain is expires in 1 month, the full year will be charged though privacy will be
	active only for 1 month.
	
	If "period" or "expyear" spans beyond domain expiration, request will fail.
	
	Privacy is domain-bound option, it expires when domain expires. It may be renewed when
	renewing domain.

	If specific value is not present, it will not be touched. Modification
	of name-servers or DNSSEC parameters will replace currently defined set
	of DNSSEC keys or name-servers.
	
	NOTE: DNSSEC parameters (ds-N) must be specified in order (ds-1, ds-2 etc),
	and due to technical limitations this is impossible to modify only specific
	key - they must be set all at once. This means that any request to modify DNSSEC
	records will *replace* existing keys with only those which are provided!
	
	Example for adding one key (and enabling DNSSEC):
	
	http://dmapi.joker.com/request/domain-modify?domain=example.com&dnssec=1&ds-1=9934:8:1:C4BF75B16AF82888B61E28951BEF27804B60D968
	
	Example for removing DNSSEC information:
	
	http://dmapi.joker.com/request/domain-modify?domain=example.com&dnssec=0

	specify "force=1", otherwise request will be rejected.

	IMPORTANT: Please note that this feature must not be used for "domain tasting"
	or "front running", and if you delete more than 1 domain per 12 registered
	per month, you will not be refunded!

	The format of a zone definition is as follows (one record per line):
	
	<label> <type> <pri> <target> <ttl> <valid-from> <valid-to> <parameters(s)>

	Where:

		label		subdomain/redirection label, relative to

	records.
	
	<ttl> must be at least 300 for all records except NAPTR and SVC, where
	it can be 0 (meaning: no caching). For MAILFW/URL/FRAME <ttl> is
	irrelevant and assumed to be 60 seconds (i.e., any change will be
	in effect within 60 seconds from zone change).
	
	<pri> preference value for MX records, priority/weight for SRV records
	and order/preference for NAPTR records. For any other record, the value
	must be 0.
	
	Examples of zone records:
	
	www		A	    0	127.0.0.1		    86400
	www		AAAA	0	fec0::17		    86400
	
	@		MX	    10	mail.example.com.	86400

    URL record format:

	redirect	URL	0	http://joker.com		86400

	FRAME record format:

	Sets redirection from redirect.joker.com to http://joker.com (assuming that
	current zone is "joker.com").

	frame		FRAME	0	http://joker.com		86400	0 0 "Header: Frame-Forward" "head" "title" "body"

		Extra text placed in <head></head> section of generated HTML.
		Title text (<title></title>) of generated HTML.
		Body text (used for <noframes> section)

	MAILFW record format:

	username	MAILFW	0	redirected@example.com	86400	0 0 1
	
	This MAILFW records makes redirection of mail sent to username@joker.com (assuming
	that current zone name is "joker.com") to redirected@example.com, extra parameter ("1")
	specifies that spam-filtering should be used.

	NAPTR record format:

	naptr		NAPTR	10/100	replacement		86400	0 0 "flags" "service" "regex"
	
	This NAPTR record has order 10 and preference 100. Only one of "replacement" or "regex" may be
	specified, if "regex" is specified, "replacement" must be "." (without quotes), if "replacement"

	txt		TXT	0	"key=value"		86400
	
	Quoting of values for TXT records is mandatory.

	CNAME record format:

	www		CNAME	0	example.com.		86400

	DYNA and DYNAAAA records:

	Two special record types, DYNA and DYNAAAA, are used for DynDNS purposes.
	They have same meaning as corresponding "A" and "AAAA" records, except that
	their targets may be updated using Joker DynDNS service.
	
	To enable/disable DynDNS service, and to defined username/password used to access
	it, the record format is as follows:
	
	$dyndns=yes:username:password
	
	username/password may not contain spaces or colon (":") characters. If "no" is
	specified instead of "yes", DynDNS will be turned off (i.e. DYN* entries will
	have no effect).
	
	All empty lines, or lines starting with "#" character are ignored.
	
	In case if there are any errors, zone modification will not be accepted.
	All errorswill be reported for every erroneous line, so if there are more
	than one, you will be able to see all detectable errors.
